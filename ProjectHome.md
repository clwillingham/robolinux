Idea: A linux distribution designed to be the controller of a robot. The idea is to use a Computer as the Microcontroller (such as an ARM, or AVR, or even the NXT).

This Distro would make robotics projects using standard processor architecture (such as Intel or AMD processors), considerably easier to program.


RoboLinux will most likely be based off of TinyCore Linux because of its small size and its simplicity.
